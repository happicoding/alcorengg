                <p>The days of manual drafting and storage of drawings are long gone. CAD uses computer technology for design and design documentation. The CAD software replaces manual drafting with an automated process.

                  <br />

                  The Process of manual drafting is simply unable to adapt to today’s markets where the customers expect high level of accuracy and minimum cycle time. The latest CAD software’s provides the users with a number of advantages compared to manual drafting. It helps you explore design ideas, visualize concepts through photo-realistic renderings, and simulate how a design will perform in the real world.
                  
                  <br />
                  The use of software also allows rescue of design and automatically keeps track of design dependencies so that when the engineer changes one value, all other values that depend on it are automatically changed accordingly.
                  
                  <br />                  
                  Simply put, CAD tools assist you with the experimentation, exploration, and iteration needed to make the most of your design’s potential. This allows the creation of better products more efficiently and at less cost so that you get your products to market faster.</p>

                <p>It is a process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object or system through analysis of its structure, function and operation. It is used to copy and replicate an existing part or tool. The 3D model result from above processes can be used for restoring worn parts, analysing distortions, benchmarking, and Rapid prototype modeling. Cost can be noticeably cut down by simplifying and shortening the entire designing process, skipping trial and error stages.

                <p>Creating cutting edge design is one thing. But what if the design is not feasible from the manufacturing perspective? That renders the design ineffective. It’s not just enough to create creative designs. It’s our responsibility to make the design a practical one.

                  <br/>

                  During the design phase the main thing to be kept in mind is that the current manufacturing and assembly facilities should be able to handle the respective functions without the need for any additional capital investment. We apply the principles of DFMA to optimize the product design with manufacturing and assembly.
                  
                  <br/>
                  DFMA in itself is a combination of two methodologies.
                  <br/>
                  Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
                  Design for Assembly (DFA)
                  DFM stresses the importance of creating the design that is easy to manufacture which leads to a reduced production cost. On the other hand, DFA underlines the significance of a design that makes the assembly process as ease and fast as possible that calls for a lower component count. In short the designers are tasked to keep unnecessary parts to a bare minimum.
                  <br/>
                  
                  At Alcor, we have embraced this rather old methodology to help our clients make the maximum out of their product.</p>

                  Our rapid prototyping service is often used to produce a physical sample of a product design. It can be used to evaluate the form, fit and function of a part or to test out new and innovative idea.
                  
                  <br/>
                  Prototypes are often made quickly using cheaper and less robust materials. We produce “rapid” prototypes because many clients need to produce a physical part quickly in order to validate a design or to capture a fleeting sales opportunity.
